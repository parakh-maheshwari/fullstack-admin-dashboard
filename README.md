Fullstack Admin Dashboard

- This is a full-stack web application developed for an online coding assignment.
- The application consists of a public landing page and an admin dashboard.

- The frontend is built using React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS.
- The backend is built using FastAPI.
- MongoDB Atlas is used as the database.

- The public landing page allows users to:
  - View projects
  - View client testimonials
  - Submit contact details
  - Subscribe to the newsletter

- The admin dashboard allows administrators to:
  - Add projects
  - Add clients
  - View contact form submissions
  - View newsletter subscribers

- All data is stored in MongoDB and fetched dynamically using REST APIs.
- Separate API routes are used for admin and dashboard functionalities.
- Pydantic models are used to validate request data in the backend.

- Backend APIs were tested using Swagger UI.
- Frontend and backend integration was tested locally.

- This project demonstrates frontend development, backend API development, database integration, and debugging skills.
